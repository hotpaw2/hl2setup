## command line version of hl2setup

This repository contains a modifed version of hl2setup.
I needed to run it from a headless Raspberry Pi, so I modified 
the original sources so that the code could be compiled with a C compiler
and hl2setup could be run from a terminal command line, 
instead of a windowing environment.

The original hl2setup code can be found here:

Information on the Hermes Lite 2 can be found on these web sites:
